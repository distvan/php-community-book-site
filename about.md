# About the Project

## 🌱 Our Mission

The **PHP Community Book** project began with a simple idea:  
*If developers can share their knowledge publicly, why not turn it into something that also helps the world?*

This project creates:

- a useful professional e-book for developers  
- a place for the community to collaborate  
- a recurring charitable donation stream

## 💙 Our Charity Goal

All income from the book is donated.  
Our current recommended organization:

### **Room to Read**  
A respected global nonprofit focusing on:
- Literacy education  
- Girls’ education  
- Building libraries  
- Providing books to under-resourced communities  

They operate in 16+ countries and are trusted worldwide.

## 🧱 How the Project Works

1. Developers submit knowledge in the form of questions or tips.  
2. Reviewers verify quality.  
3. Everything is grouped into categories.  
4. The book is formatted for Amazon Kindle.  
5. All revenue is donated — transparently.

## 🔒 Why the Repository Is Private

To protect the future value of the e-book and avoid piracy, the main repository is private.  
Only approved contributors can access it.

The public GitHub Pages site serves as the project’s “front door”.
