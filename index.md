### A global, community-built e-book created by PHP developers — published for charity.

## 🌍 What Is This Project?

**PHP Community Book** is a collaborative project where PHP developers from around the world submit:

- challenging interview-style questions  
- best-practice tips  
- insights from real-world work  
- lessons learned from experience  

All entries are reviewed and curated into a professional **charity e-book published on Amazon Kindle**.

💙 **100% of every sale supports children’s education**  
(Current suggested charity: *Room to Read*.)

## ❤️ Why We Created This

We believe the PHP community has collective wisdom worth sharing — and that this wisdom can help:

- new developers learn  
- experienced developers interview  
- teams evaluate candidates  
- children around the world receive better access to education  

This is a book the community writes **together**, and the world benefits.
